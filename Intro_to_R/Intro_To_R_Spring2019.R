### R Interface Basics--------------------------------------------------------------
## R as a Calculator
#simple to complex equations
1+2
[1] 3

sin(pi*15)/100
[1] 5.389623e-17

# Objects and Assignment Statements
#Hint alt - is a shortcut for the < - 
x <- 1+2
x
y <- x +1
y

## Naming Convention
#short and sweet but relevent to you and any other readers of your script
#Case sensative x != X
#Must Start with a letter
#Only numbers, letters, _, and .
#Cases
#snake case "i_use_snake_case" 
#Camel Case  "iUseCamelCase"
#periods "i.use.periods"
#combinations "iCant_decide.which_toUse"

## Commenting
#Using the # sign to create a comment

1+1 # This is the formula for 1+1

## Getting Help in R
help(mean)
#HINT: if you can't remember exactly what function you are looking for, Use Tab
me "Tab"

## Creating a list of numbers
list <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

#However what if you wanted to create a list to 100?
list <- 1:100

# Easy because the list is in order but now we want a list of 1:100 by 2?
# This is were we want to introduce functions
#Simple function format: function_name(argument #1 = value #1, argument #2 = value #2)
#HINT: Use the ? to find R documentation on an object
?seq()

seq(1,10)

# TASK 1B #
#Create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 by 0.5 and save it to an object called Seq1
Seq <- seq(1,10, by =0.5) #define step by value
Seq2 <- seq(1,10, length.out = 5) #Defined number of values


##Functions
#function format: function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2)
