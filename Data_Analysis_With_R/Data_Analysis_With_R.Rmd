## Workshop Summary and Contact Information

**Summary:** R is a free and powerful programming language that is commonly used by researchers in both qualitative and quantitative disciplines. R provides a near comprehensive, and still expanding set of research and data analysis tools. This workshop explores the power of R for data analysis and visualization. The focus of this workshop will be hands-on exercises. No programming experience is required, but a basic comprehension of programming and statistics is benefiticial.

### Section I: Brief Introduction R 

##### 1. R for basic calculation
```{r}
sin(pi*15)/100
```


##### 2. R Objects & Assignment
R stores values and objects so they can be reused throughout an equation or script\
Hint alt - is a shortcut for the < - 
```{r}
x <- 1+2
y <- x +1
y
```

#### 3. Understanding functions & Getting Help in R
General recipe for functions:
```{r eval=FALSE}
function_name(argument #1 = value #1,
              argument #2 = value #2)
```

Going back to our series task, we want to create a series of numbers from 1 to 100 by 2. Luckily there are many functions already available to use in base R (many many more available from packages, which we will discuss later).\
\
Given that we are just learning R, I will tell you that the function is called "seq()"\
The first thing I do when using a new functions is to look at the documentation. You can use the ? to find R documentation.\

**HINT: Scroll to the bottom of the help page for workable examples.**\
```{r eval=FALSE}
?seq()
```

**HINT: if you can't remember exactly what function you are looking for, Use Tab.**
```{r eval=FALSE}
me<tab>
```

Additionally, if you are not sure what the function is called try a fuzzy search.\
```{r eval=FALSE}
apropos("mea") 
```


##### 1. R for basic calculation
### Section II: Exploring the Tidyverse!

#### Install and Load the tidyverse package

```{r}
require("tidyverse")
require("gapminder")
```

#### Explore the Tidyverse 
https://www.tidyverse.org/

R packages only have to be installed once but loaded everytime.\
Using require is a nice way to make sure every script has the packages needed which combines install.packages() & library()

#### 1. Basic Data Exploration
In this section we will use the gapminder data set
https://www.gapminder.org/

##### Lets assign this to gapminder
```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder
```

##### View our table
```{r eval=FALSE}
View(gapminder)
```

##### Lists the variables 
```{r}
names(gapminder)
```

##### Lets Examine the structure of the data
```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

This will become very useful when we visualize or analyze data, because we must make sure our variables are in the appropriate format!!

##### Statistical summary of the data
```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```

#### 2. Exploring our data further
**HINT: Understanding how data is indexed is crutial for R programming**

##### Lets look at column 2 
```{r}
gapminder[,2]
```

gapminder[,2]

##### Lets look at row 5
```{r}
gapminder[5,]
```


##### What value is in row 5 column 3?
```{r}
gapminder[5,3]
```


##### Based on this idea, we can make more complicated searches. Lets take the first ten observations and look at the variables:Country (1), Continent(2), Year (3), and population (5)
```{r}
gapminder[1:10,c(1:3, 5)]
```

##### What if we want to know the highest gpdPercap
```{r}
max(gapminder$gdpPercap)

```

##### Lets find the row number of the country with the highest gpdpercap
```{r}
which.max(gapminder$gdpPercap)
```

Then show me all columns for row that row

```{r}
gapminder[854,]
```


#### 2. The filter verb
The filter verb is used to look at a subset of a data set.\
Typically you combine filter with a pipe %>%

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "United States")
```


##### Multiple conditions
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007, country == "United States")
```


#### The arrange verb 
Used for sorting data by ascending or descending condition\

##### Ascending Order
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  arrange(gdpPercap)
```


##### Descending order
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap))
```


##### Combining verbs
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  arrange(gdpPercap)
```


#### The mutate verb
Change or Add variables to a data set

##### Change a variable
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(pop = pop/1000000)
```


##### Add a new variable called gdp
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = gdpPercap * pop)
```

#### Combine all three verbs 
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = gdpPercap * pop) %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdp))
```

#### The Summarize Verb 
##### Summarize entire data set
Returns the mean of all rows (one value)
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  summarize(meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
```

##### What if we want to return the mean life exp just for 2007
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
```


##### Creating multiple Summaries
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp),
            totalPop = sum(pop))
```

**HINT: What data type is pop? Use str(gapminder)**

##### Convert pop to a numeric data type instead of an integer
```{r}
gapminder$pop <- as.numeric(gapminder$pop)
```


#### The group_by Verb 
The group_by verb is useful for creating aggregated groups, especially when combined with the summarize function

##### Summarize by each unique year
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp),
            totalPop = sum(pop))
```


##### Summarize data from 2007 by continent
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarize(meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp),
            totalPop = sum(pop))
```

##### What if we want to summarize by continent over all years?
**HINT: Simply add an additional arguement to the group_by verb**
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year, continent) %>% 
  summarize(meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp),
            totalPop = sum(pop))
```

#### Section III Tasks
Answer the following questions using the mtcars dataset
```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars
```

##### Task 3A. find the median mpg & wt for each group of cylinders  
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarize(median_mpg = median(mpg),
            median_wt = median(wt))
```


##### Task 3B. find the mean of hp and drat for each group of gear and cyl & 
          #find the ratio between mean hp and mean drat
          
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl,gear) %>% 
  summarize(mean_drat = mean(drat),
            mean_hp = mean(hp),
            hp_drat_ratio = mean_hp/mean_drat)
```





















### Section III: Data Visualization
Useful resources for using base plot in R\
https://www.harding.edu/fmccown/r/\
https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/index.html\

#### Default Plot
```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg)
```

#### Dotchart
```{r}
dotchart(mtcars$mpg)
```

Adding details and labels to a Simple Dotplot

```{r}
dotchart(mtcars$mpg,
         labels=row.names(mtcars),
         main="Gas Milage for Car Models", 
         xlab="Miles Per Gallon")
```

#### Histogram
```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

##### Add color and explore bin sizes

```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks=5, col="red")
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks=10, col="red")
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks=15, col="red")
```

#### Kernel Density Plot
First you need to save the density of the data you want to an R object\
Then plot that object using plot()
```{r}
d <- density(mtcars$mpg) # returns the density data 
plot(d) # plots the results
```

#### Barplot
```{r}
barplot(mtcars$cyl)
```
HINT:: To fist create a variable called "count" to count the number of each group\
Then use the barplot() function on the object counts
```{r}
counts <- table(mtcars$cyl)
barplot(counts)
```

##### Add Chart Title and Axes

```{r}
barplot(counts, 
        main="Car Distribution", 
        xlab="Number of Gears")
```

##### Converting a Bar chart into a Stacked Bar
```{r}
counts <- table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear)
barplot(counts,
        main="Car Distribution by Cylinders and Gears",
        xlab="Number of Gears",
        col = c("darkred","darkblue","orange"),
        legend = rownames(counts))

```

#### Box Plots
```{r}
boxplot(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$cyl)
```

##### Boxplot with labels
```{r}
boxplot(mpg~cyl,
        data=mtcars,
        main="Car Milage Data", 
        xlab="Number of Cylinders",
        ylab="Miles Per Gallon")
```

#### Pie Charts

```{r}
slices <- table(mtcars$cyl)
lbls <- c("Four", "Six", "Eight")
pie(slices,
    labels = lbls,
    main="Pie Chart of mtcars Cylindars")
```

#### Scatterplot
##### Simple Scatterplot
```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg)
```

##### Add labels
```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg,
     main="Scatterplot Example", 
     xlab="Car Weight ",
     ylab="Miles Per Gallon ",
     pch=19)
```

#####Add linear regression line 
Regression line is (y~x) 
```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg,
     main="Scatterplot Example", 
     xlab="Car Weight ",
     ylab="Miles Per Gallon ",
     pch=19,
     abline(lm(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$wt), col="red"))
```

####Line Graphs
```{r}
lines <- c(1:2,4,7,5,8,10,7)
plot(lines)
```

##### Graph line using blue points overlayed by a line 
```{r}
plot(lines, type="o", col="blue")
```

##### Add a title
```{r}
plot(lines, type="o", col="blue",
     main="My Line Graph")
```
